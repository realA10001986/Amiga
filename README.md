# Amiga
A collection of Amiga stuff

dsp3210dist: A package for getting the DSP 3210 on AA3000+ boards going. Contains drivers, example code, Changelog and README to get you started.

GALs: The pld and jed files for U122, U123, U124 and U701 for the AA3000+. Some bugs of the originals in the Haynie archives have been fixed. 

Numerous tests showed that GAL speed is important. The recommended combination is
- ATF22V10C-5JX for U122 and U124 
- either ATF22V10C-5JX or ATF22V10C-10JU for U123
- ATF16V8BQL-15JU for U701.
