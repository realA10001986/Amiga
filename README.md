# Amiga
A collection of Amiga stuff

dsp3210dist: A package for getting the DSP 3210 on AA3000+ boards going. Contains drivers, example code, Changelog and README to get you started.

GALs: The pld and jed files for U122, U123, U124 and U701 for the AA3000+. Several bugs of the originals in the Haynie archives have been fixed. 

However, at this point it looks like using Amtel ATF22V10s instead of real GALs for some reason does not work reliably. Investigation ongoing.

For more information and documents on the DSP in question, see Wrangler's repo at https://github.com/Wrangler491/AA3000-DSP
