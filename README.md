# Amiga
A collection of Amiga stuff

dsp3210dist: A package for getting the DSP 3210 on AA3000+ boards going. Contains drivers, example code, Changelog and README to get you started.

GALs: The pld and jed files for U122, U123, U124 and U701 for the AA3000+. Several bugs of the originals in the Haynie archives have been fixed. 

However, at this point it looks like speed and "GAL or ATF" is a close call and many combinations fail to work reliably. Investigation ongoing. For now, a combination of ATF22V10C-7JU for U122 and U123, ATF22V10C-5JX for U124 and ATF16V8C-7JU for U701 looks most promising.
